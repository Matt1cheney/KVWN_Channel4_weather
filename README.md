# KVWN_Channel4_weather

1.) i want the weather
   i need a function for a get() request
2.) I want to search for the weather by location
    i need a function that when i search something it will fire the get() request
3.) when I hit search, i want to display this coming weeks weather.
    with the information i receive i need to print on screen.
    ill need to input the information into an array and then display it onto seperate blocks. probably use forEach().
4.) I want to store my recent searches in local storage.
    i need a function to store stuff in the local storage.
    i need to JSON.stringify my info to be able to store it
    I need to create a function to JSON.parse and then return the info on screen.
5.) i want icons to represent the weather. (cloudy shows a cloud icon)
    i need to grab the icon and then probably use if and else statements to decide what and when to show certain icons
6.) i want to take this one step at a time.
